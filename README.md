# 🏥 Healthcare Revenue & Fraud Audit Analysis
# SQL • Power BI • Healthcare Analytics • Fraud Detection

Healthcare fraud costs the global insurance industry over ****$455**** billion annually. This project builds an end-to-end SQL and Power BI audit framework to detect, classify, and quantify four fraud patterns across ****1,500**** patient billing records — surfacing ****₹248M in fraudulent claims**** and a ****40.87% overall fraud rate****.






# 📌 Project Overview
A complete data analysis project designed to detect and quantify fraudulent healthcare billing patterns using SQL for deep data interrogation and Power BI for executive-ready visual reporting. The project classifies billing records into four fraud categories — ****Phantom Billing, Fake Treatment, Ghost Enrollee,**** and ****No Fraud**** — and delivers actionable financial insights that support audit, compliance, and risk management decisions.

## 🔢 Key Findings

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Total Patient Records Analyzed | 1,500 |
| Legitimate Cases | 887 |
| Fraudulent Cases | 613 |
| ****Overall Fraud Rate**** | **40.87%** |
| Total Amount Billed | ₹476,484,930 |
| Total Fraudulent Amount | ₹248,079,958 |
| Phantom Billing Total | ₹112,168,420 |
| Fake Treatment Total | ₹92,816,805 |
| Ghost Enrollee Total | ₹43,094,731 |
| ****Fraud Share of Total Revenue**** | **52.06%** |

> Over ****52% of total billed revenue**** is linked to fraudulent activity —
> with Phantom Billing alone accounting for ****₹112M****.

## 💰 Average Billing by Fraud Type

| Fraud Type | Cases | Avg Amount Billed | vs Legitimate |
|---|---|---|---|
| No Fraud | 887 | ₹257,502 | baseline |
| Ghost Enrollee | 164 | ₹262,772 | +2% |
| Fake Treatment | 243 | ₹381,962 | **+48% higher** |
| Phantom Billing | 206 | ₹544,506 | **+111% higher** |

> Phantom Billing cases are billed ****2.1× higher**** than legitimate claims (₹544,506 vs ₹257,502) — the strongest financial fraud signal in the dataset.

# 📖 Foundings — The Data Story

# The Scale of the Problem
Out of 1,500 patient records audited, ****613 cases (40.87%) were fraudulent****, with fraud accounting for
₹248 million — ****52.06% of all revenue billed****. In other words, for every ₹2 billed, more than ₹1
was fraudulent. This is not a fringe problem; it is the dominant billing pattern in this dataset.

---
# Not All Fraud Is Equal

Phantom Billing is the most dangerous fraud type — not just because it bills at 2× the legitimate
rate, but because it targets the most expensive procedures. Ghost Enrollee fraud is the most
deceptive — billing almost identically to legitimate cases (+2%), making it nearly impossible to
detect without cross-referencing admission and discharge dates.

---

# High-Value Procedures Are Being Systematically Exploited

Eight diagnoses showed a ****100% fraud rate**** — every single case filed under these procedures was fraudulent:

| Diagnosis | Fraud Cases | Avg Billing (₹) | Total Fraud (₹) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Epilepsy Surgery | 23 | 625,052 | 14,376,200 |
| Infertility Treatment (IVF) | 33 | 583,118 | 19,242,906 |
| Cosmetic Surgery | 27 | 581,172 | 15,691,632 |
| Organ Transplant | 23 | 579,659 | 13,332,161 |
| Cancer Treatment | 30 | 491,026 | 14,730,770 |
| Complex Heart Surgery | 26 | 506,539 | 13,170,025 |
| Neurosurgery | 21 |503,447 | 10,572,384
| Advanced Spinal Surgery | 23 | 480,537 | 11,052,342 |

Fraudsters specifically chose ****high-cost, hard-to-verify surgical procedures**** where phantom billing is difficult to dispute. Epilepsy Surgery had the highest average billing at ₹625,052 — nearly 2.5× the legitimate baseline. ****IVF fraud alone accounts for ₹19.2 million**** — the single largest fraudulent diagnosis category.

# Common Conditions Are Also at Risk

| Diagnosis | Total Cases | Fraud Cases | Fraud Rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hypertension | 90 | 35 | 38.89% |
| Tuberculosis | 103 | 40 | 38.83% |
| Gastroenteritis | 90 | 33 | 36.67% |
| Stroke | 84 | 28 | 33.33% |
| Pneumonia | 102 | 34 | 33.33% |
| Cesarean Section | 90 | 29 | 32.22% |

Tuberculosis had the highest case volume (103 records) with a 38.83% fraud rate — making it the most fraud-infiltrated high-volume condition. These conditions are targeted because they are common,frequently billed, and harder to audit at scale.

# Every Age Group Is a Target — But Patterns Differ

| Age Group | Dominant Fraud Type | Avg Billing (₹) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0–18 | Phantom Billing | 677,960 |
| 19–35 | Phantom Billing | 524,915 |
| 36–55 | Fake Treatment | 367,154 |
| 56–75 | Phantom Billing | 560,497 |
| 76+ | Phantom Billing | 548,259 |

🔴 ****Children (0–18)**** face the highest average Phantom Billing at ₹677,960 — the most expensive fraud of any age group, and the least likely to self-report

🟠 ****The 76+ group**** had the highest Ghost Enrollee count (48 cases) — elderly records are less actively monitored

🟡 ****The 36–55 group**** shifts to Fake Treatment — fraudsters adapt their method to what's plausible per age profile

---
# The Worst Individual Cases
The highest single fraudulent claim was ****₹988,887**** for a Cosmetic Surgery Phantom Billing case — nearly 4× the legitimate average. All top 20 worst offending cases involved Phantom Billing across Cosmetic Surgery, Organ Transplant, Complex Heart Surgery, Epilepsy Surgery, IVF, Neurosurgery, Advanced Spinal Surgery, and Cancer Treatment.

---

# The Bottom Line

₹248 million fraudulently billed. Eight surgical procedures at 100% fraud rate. Children billed at the highest phantom rates. The elderly disproportionately used as ghost enrollees. Phantom Billing costs 111% more than a legitimate claim.
****Healthcare fraud is not random. It is systematic, targeted, and concentrated in predictable places — which means it is detectable, and preventable, with the right data tools.****

WITH diagnosis_summary AS (
    SELECT
        Diagnosis,
        COUNT(*) AS total_cases,
        SUM(CASE WHEN `Fraud Type` != 'No Fraud' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS fraud_cases,
        ROUND(AVG(`Amount Billed`), 2) AS avg_billed
    FROM fraud
    GROUP BY Diagnosis
)
SELECT
    Diagnosis,
    total_cases,
    fraud_cases,
    ROUND(fraud_cases * 100.0 / total_cases, 2) AS fraud_rate_pct,
    avg_billed
FROM diagnosis_summary
ORDER BY fraud_rate_pct DESC;
```
